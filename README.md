# Blogo

## Overview

**Blogo** is an early project aimed at creating a full-featured blogging platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) combined with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The project aimed to provide a user-friendly blogging experience but encountered challenges due to the lack of a clear feature plan from the start. This experience highlights the importance of planning and structuring features before diving into development.

## Project Goals

The initial goal was to create a platform where users could:

- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Customize post layouts and styles with Tailwind CSS
- Authenticate users with secure login and register options
- Implement a user-friendly interface with responsive design

## Challenges and Learning

While working on Blogo, a few major challenges surfaced:

- **Scope Creep**: Additional features were introduced during development, which made the project difficult to manage.
- **Feature Planning**: Without a clear set of features defined at the beginning, maintaining focus became difficult, leading to an unstructured codebase.
- **Early Stage Learning**: This project provided invaluable learning about the MERN stack, TypeScript, and project planning best practices, helping shape future projects.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Huzaifa-Yaqoob/blogoo.git
   cd blogoo
   ```

2. Set up the frontend:

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Set up the backend:

   ```sh
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

## Key Takeaways

Despite not reaching completion, Blogo taught key lessons in:

- **Project Planning**: Importance of defining a roadmap with features, milestones, and priorities.
- **TypeScript and MERN Stack Fundamentals**: Building foundational skills in backend and frontend integration.
